# bool-expression

##### bool-expression takes a propositional formula as an input and contains functions to output a truth table, and the formula's Conjunctive and Disjunctive Normal Forms. 

##### bool-expression is a project for my CSCI2243 (Logic) class. I am currently expanding its functionality as I learn more about boolean logic. The first ~25 lines were written by my professor, Carl McTague.
